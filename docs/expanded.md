Several [widget types](http://uportal-project.github.io/uportal-app-framework/make-a-widget.html) are pictured in the image above. All of them demonstrate:

* Configurable title text (across the top of each tile)
* Configurable launch text (across the bottom of each tile)
* Info icon (displayed on hover): Shows the app description of the selected widget
* Delete icon (displayed on hover): Removes the widget from the user's layout

## App-Framework styles

Some of the CSS styles for widgets are located in the App-Framework project. You can read about those styles in frame's [widget.less file on Github](https://github.com/uPortal-Project/uportal-app-framework/blob/master/components/css/buckyless/widget.less).
