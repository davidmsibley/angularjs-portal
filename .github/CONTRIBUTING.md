# Contributing to `uPortal Home`

In short:

+ [Be kind][code of conduct].
+ All Contributors must appear in the public [Apereo CLA roster][].
+ Use [Google code style][].
+ Use [Conventional Commits][].

However: *please do not let contribution guidance be an insurmountable barrier to your contribution.* Project participants can work with you to hone your contribution, but only if we know you're trying to contribute.

## Code of conduct

The [Apereo Welcoming Policy][] [applies][code of conduct].

## Contributor License Agreements

As an [incubating, aspiring Apereo product][uPortal Home website on incubating], `uPortal Home` requires contributors and contributions to comply with [Apereo inbound intellectual property licensing practices][].

The short version:

+ You must have submitted an [Apereo Individual Contributor License Agreement][]
+ You individually must actually appear in the [roster of registered ICLAs][Apereo CLA roster].
+ To the extent that you're working under the auspices of an employer or working on behalf of anyone or anything other than yourself individually, those entities must have submitted a [Apereo Corporate Contributor License Agreement][] naming you as an authorized contributor.
+ Those entities must actually appear in [the roster of registered CCLAs][Apereo CLA roster].

The long version:

+ [Apereo website on licensing][]
+ [Apereo website on Contributor License Agreement][]

*Please* provide feedback about how these practices impact your ability to contribute. You might voice that feedback on the [Apereo licensing discussion Google Group][] or in any other way in which you are comfortable.
